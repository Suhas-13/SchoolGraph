# SchoolGraph

A project to scrape available student/course data from Schoology(a web-based platform used by schools to manage courses/students) and generate a graph with. 

Use Cases:
- Contact tracing, get a quick list of students who might've associated with another student in a school day(based on classes in common)
- Shortest path identification (implemented in java), allows the identification of a shortest path between two students based on courses in common and visualization in Java.

* Python scraping code written a while ago and may be messy, Java code was written more recently for visualization.
